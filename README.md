## NANOFROGGER - Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Project 3

This project is a take on the classic Frogger arcade game. It was built using Javascript and HTML5 Canvas.

Instructions:

- **Select a character on the main screen and press the "PLAY" button**
- **Use the arrows keys to move your character up the board until you reach the water at which point you will have completed the stage and will be returned to the bottom to keep playing.** 
- **Along the way, pick up various collectible objects to obtain more points.**
- **Avoid being run into by enemy bugs which will deduct points and lives. The game ends when you have used up all of your 3 lives.**
