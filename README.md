## NANOFROGGER - Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Project 3

This project is a take on the classic frogger arcade game. It uses Object-oriented Javascript to generate the game functionality.

Instructions:

- **Select a character on the main screen and press the "PLAY" button**
- **Move your character up the board until you reach the water at which point you will have completed the stage and will be returned to the bottom to keep playing.** 
- **Along the way, pick up various collectible objects to obtain more points.**
- **Avoid being run into by enemy bugs which will deduct points and lives. The game ends when you have used up all of your 3 lives.**
