## NANOFROGGER - A Javascript/HTML5 Canvas Game Based on the Classic, Frogger Arcade Game

This project is a take on the classic, Frogger arcade game. It was built using Javascript OOP and the HTML5 Canvas. I originally created it as a project for the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

**Instructions:**

- **To play the game locally, simply download the project's zip file and open the index.html file in your web browser.**
- **To play the hosted version of the game, visit: http://jastylr.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/.**

**Game Control:**
- **On the main splash screen, press the "PLAY" button to begin playing the game.**
- **Use the arrows keys on your keyboard to move the frog around the game board.** 
- **Cross the road while avoiding being run over by one of the vehicles in your path.**
- **Make your way across the water by jumping onto the various logs and lilypads floating by. Don't fall into the water or you'll lose a life.**
- **Along your way, pick up collectible gems to score additional points.** 
- **Eat dragonflies and house flies that fly vertically across the screen to add to your health. Gain an additional life for every 5 insects that you eat.**
- **Watch out for predators (Raccoons and Snakes) which occupy various spaces on the game board. Run into on of these creatures and you'll lose a life.**
- **When you cross the water and reach the top of the board, you will be returned to the bottom to keep playing. Be careful as there are predators and boulders that limit your access to the top of the game board.** 
- **The game ends when you have used up all of your lives.**
