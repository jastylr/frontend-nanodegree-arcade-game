## NANOFROGGER - Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Project 3

This project is a take on the classic Frogger arcade game. It was built using Javascript and HTML5 Canvas.

Instructions:

- **Select a character on the main screen and press the "PLAY" button to begin**
- **Use the arrows keys to move your character up the board until you reach the water at which point you will have completed the stage, gathered points and will be returned to the bottom to keep playing.** 
- **Along the way, pick up various collectible objects that appear on the game board to obtain additional points.**
- **Avoid being run over by enemy bugs which will deduct from your points and lives. The game ends when you have used up all of your 3 lives.**
