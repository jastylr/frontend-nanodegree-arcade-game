- **On the main screen, press the "PLAY" button to begin the game**
- **Use the arrows keys to move frog around the game board while avoiding cars and predators**
- **When you cross the water and reach the top of the board, you will be returned to the bottom to keep playing.** 
- **Along the way, pick up various collectible objects that appear on the game board to obtain additional points.**
- **The game ends when you have used up all of your 3 lives.**
